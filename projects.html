	    <p><strong>Chemical Environment Adaptive Learning for Optical Band Gap Prediction of Doped Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets:</strong>
	    Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) and its doped variants have sparked significant interest for their potential as optical materials.
	    Accurate prediction of their band gaps is crucial for practical applications, however, it is extremely challenging and computationally expensive to explore all
	    possible doped molecular structures using traditional quantum simulation methods. In this study, we leverage the recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs)
	    and developed a novel Chemical Graph Neural Network (ChemGNN) with adaptive learning for material property prediction. The proposed ChemGNN can satisfactorily
	    capture the characteristics of atoms' local chemical environment and greatly enhance the learning ability of complex molecular structures. Our benchmark results
	    demonstrate a more than 100% improvement in band gap prediction accuracy over existing GNNs on g-C3N4 and its doped variant. Moreover, the proposed model's
	    learning power is promising, and it can be potentially applied to predicting other structure-dependent molecular properties, such as nuclear magnetic resonance
	    chemical shifts. Overall, the ChemGNN model offers a promising approach to enhance predictions of molecular properties, which could have broad applications
	    in various fields, including material science, drug discovery, and computational chemistry. Submitted to <em>Nature Communications</em>.

    <p><strong>Study the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to human cell receptor ACE<sub>2</sub>:</strong>
    Allosteric regulation is common in protein-protein interactions and is thus promising in drug design. Nevertheless, the mechanism of
    allosteric regulation remains elusive for most proteins, including SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, despite extensive experimental endeavors
    over the past years. In the present computational study, the route of allosteric regulation of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is examined by
    all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with contrastive machine learning. It was found that peptide
    binding to the polybasic cleavage sites, especially the one at the first monomer of the trimeric spike protein, activates the fluctuation
    of the spike protein’s backbone. This fluctuation eventually propagates to the nitrogen-terminal domain and its neighboring receptor-binding
    domain, remarkably weakening the latter’s binding affinity to the human cell receptor ACE2. Our study justifies the presence of allosteric
    regulation in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, paving the way for the rational design of allosteric antibody inhibitors.

    <p><strong>Protein Folding Path Study using Self-supervised Learning:</strong> One of my ongoing projects is to use deep learning models to study the protein molecule structure evolution during the adsorption process
    on interfaces. In our preliminary investigation published in <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01172" target="_blank">the Journal of
    Chemical Theory and Computation</a>, a computational efficient discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulation combined with the Go-like model is used to study
    peptide/protein adsorption behavior. The simulated adsorption process can be represented by the adsorption trajectory and the effects of surface to the protein/peptide
    structure can be represented by the secondary structure and contact map evolution. A contact map is a two-dimensional matrix, in which the value at location
    (<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) is the distance between the alpha-carbons in the <i>i-th</i> and <i>j-th</i> amino acid in the chain. Self-supervised deep learning models will be trained to extract
    a representation of contact map data. The representatio will then be clustered to segment the evolution processes into stages. Each stage represents
    a phase of the protein molecule structure in the adsorption process. </p>

    <p><strong>Searching for Signs of Lives on Mars:</strong> Another recent work of mine applies machine-learning algorithms in the form of convolution neural networks (CNN) to dielectric spectroscopy (DS) measurement data
    to identify amino acid organic molecules and inorganic salts solutions despite similarities in their spectroscopic responses over a temperature range of
    20 to -60<sup>o</sup>C. Combining DS with machine learning will greatly facilitate more real-time decision-making of mobility systems for future exploratory endeavors
    in other worlds beyond Earth. The preliminary results have been published in the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c09266" target="_blank">

    <li><i>November, 2020:</i> Paper "Machine Learning Analysis of the Thermodynamic Responses of In-situ Dielectric Spectroscopy Data in Amino Acids and Inorganic Electrolytes" is accepted by
      the ACS Journal of Physical Chemistry B(<u>h-index</u>: 378, <u>impact factor</u>: 2.857). Dielectric spectroscopy (DS) is a robust electrochemical technique for biochemical, geobiological
      and geochemical applications. Variations in the magnitude of the fraction of constituents can be an indication of changes in chemical and biological processes. Thus, it is possible to detect
      and identify chemicals in the biochemical, geochemical and geobiological processes provided the magnitudes of fractions of constituents of the DS data can be estimated.  However, estimating
      such fractions of constituents in DS measurement of chemical mixtures is challenging, and usually inaccurate as well as time-consuming. Many factors (in addition to electrical noises) can
      impact accuracy in DS measurement, including the effects of electrode polarization, and electrode chem physical processes associated with chemical or mechanical degradation. Noisy data impact
      the estimation of fractions of constituents. All these result in poor chemical detection and identification precision. Complex problems such as this require innovative solutions. Machine learning
      (ML) is a computational approach that can learn the inherent deep characteristics from measurement data to map the inputs to outputs without being explicitly programmed. ML is well suited for
      complex problems such as detecting and identifying chemicals using DS measurement, even if the measurements are noisy. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with channel-wise one-dimensional filters
      is proposed to fulfill the task, using the DS data of amino acid and inorganic salt solutions. Experimental results show that the CNN with two convolutional layers and one fully connected layer
      can effectively differentiate solutions containing amino acids from those containing salts in both the liquid and solid (water ice) states. To complement the experimental measurements and CNN
      analysis, the diffusive behaviors of ions (K+, Cl- and OH-) were further studied with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed in this work as well as the quantum simulation
      published in the literature. Combining DS with machine-learning techniques and simulations will greatly facilitate more real-time decision-making of mobility systems for future exploratory
      endeavors in other worlds beyond Earth. <strong>This work is a collaboration with NASA JPL and Howard University.</strong>
